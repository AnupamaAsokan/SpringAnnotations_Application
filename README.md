# SpringAnnotations_Demo
Check out my Spring Framework Skills - Part 2

Hello,

This is a java application that involves the usage of Spring annotations to demonstrate my understanding of Autowiring, Component scanning, Qualifier, Bean, PostConstruct, PreDestroy, etc. I have used lastest java and spring version (4.3.7) to build this.
